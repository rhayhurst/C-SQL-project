Ran Tests for 4978 North Menard, 60630
for both air and water
between Nov 10, 2015 and Nov 24, 2015



ERRORS:

- when running Long Term Test, particulates, the "are
  the results within the EPA parameters" field not given.

- PArticulate understanding has typo:  first paragrapgh end 
  of parens has the word "for" that needs to be erased
  DONE

- clear fields needs to clear the listbox as well in View Test Results
   DONE

- should the list box be cleared for each new test?

- "ABOUT" needs to be filled out

HEADING
- in "results for multipiple dates", the dates run off the screen
  So we need to have it look like this:
  results for tests between:
  date -> date
  DONE

HEADING
- make Air Test be lower case (air test), same with Water Test
   DONE
