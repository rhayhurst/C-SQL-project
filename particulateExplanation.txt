     Air pollution (smog), is measured in particulates, literally matter suspended in the 
air. Particulates come in two size measurements, large (between 2.5 and 10 micrometers,
called PM 10 for), and small (up to 2.5 micrometers, called PM 2.5).

     The larger particulates come from smoke, dirt and dust from factories, mold, spores, 
and pollen, whereas the smaller particulates (and more dangerous) are made of toxic organic
compounds and various heavy metals.

     The EPA has two separate measures for the PM 10 and PM 2.5 particulates.  To determine 
an accurate measurement for PM 2.5, an arithemetic mean is to be taken over a three year 
period.  If it registers as greater than 12.0 µm/m3, then it is considered to be dangerous
(and illegal, for that matter).

     We realize that our users may not have three years to conduct tests, so the results that 
you see is the arithemtic mean for the number of tests taken, which is also shown.

     Additionally, note that PM 10, it is considered unsafe for any reading to be over 
150 µm/m3 for more that once per year.  Please examine the displayed test results to determine 
if that parameter has been passed.
