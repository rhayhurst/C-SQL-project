     Turbidity is a measurement of the "cloudiness" of whater, which is analogous to its purity.  
The unit of measurement used to describe turbidity is the NTU: Nephelometric Turbidity 
Unit.  Simply put, it quantifies the amount of light that can pass though a body of standing 
water.

     High turbidity can be indicative of a number of things: the quality of a water filtration 
system, the possibility of a leak in residential plumbing pipes, or soil runoff in a water 
table.  High turbidity can also indicate organic problems, such as the presence of of 
disease-causing microorganisms such as viruses, parasites and some bacteria.

     The EPA has determined drinking water to be safe if 95% of the samples taken per month 
are less than or equal to 0.3 NTUs.  We realize that our users may not have data samples 
greater than a month, so this device measures all of the samples taken, and considers the 
purity of the water to be safe if 95% of the samples taken are less than or equal to 0.3 NTU.  
The AAWQT also provides the date of the first test, the date of the last test, and the number 
of tests taken, so that the user can come to their own conclusions.
