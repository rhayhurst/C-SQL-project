# C-SQL-project
This project was written in Visual Studio, using C# and SQL.  The idea is "what if you had access to a piece of hardware that could do anything you wanted".  I decided to create a handheld water analysis tool.  Not only would the tool analyze the water in accordance to standards set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), a database is created to store and analyze the data.

If you look at the code, you can see that it's written rather procedurally -- there's a lot of repeated code in the files.  This was done on purpose, at the request of a colleague who was unfamiliar with OO principles.
