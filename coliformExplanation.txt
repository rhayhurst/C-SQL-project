     Coliform bacteria are commonly used as an indicator of the sanitary quality of water.  The
bacteria is universally found in the fecal matter of warm-blooded mammals, and and such is
used to determine if there is fecal matter in water.

     Not all coliform bacteria is pathogenic, and this particular test does not differentiate
between disease-causing bacteria such as E Coli or innocuous protozoa.  The next iteration
of the AAWQT will have a test that can spot the difference between the two types of
bacteria, so please keep aware of updates.

    The test that we perform returns either a postive (bacteria is present in the water) or
a negative (bacteria is not present in the water).  It does not test for amount of bacteria.
This is in line with the EPA, who has determined water to be safe for drinking if the tests
return negative in 95% of tests, per month.

     Of course, we realize that our users may not have data samples greater than a month.
Therefore, the AAWQT provides the percentage for all tests, regardless of the the 
number of tests taken.  However, we also provide additional data that allows for further
conclusions: the date of the first and last test and the number of tests taken in total.
